Introduction to OnStove
======================

Universal access to clean cooking
*******************************

Clean cooking is defined as fuels and stove combinations meeting the standards set by the World Health Organizationâ€™s Guidelines for Indoor Air Quality: Household Fuel Combustion1. The purpose of these guidelines is to protect public health from Household Air Pollution (HAP). As of 2020, roughly 2.4 billion people still lacked access to clean cooking globally and relied on polluting fuels to meet their daily cooking need. The use of polluting fuels are estimated to cause approximately 3.2 million pre-mature deaths annually and impede progress on gender equality and environmental quality goals2. Due to the widespread negative impacts of polluting cooking fuels, universal access to clean cooking was incorporated as one of the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG target 7.1)3. This target has in previous research been shown to be directly linked to the achievement of 85% of the other SDG targets4  Progress towards the universal clean cooking target has however proven particularly difficult. 

What is OnStove?
***************
OnStove is developed by the division of Energy Systems at KTH together with partners. The tool is a geospatial, raster-based tool determining the net-benefit of different cooking solutions selected by the user for every square kilometer (sq. km) of a given study area. The tool takes into account four benefits: reduced morbidity, mortality, emissions and time saved, as well as three costs: capital, fuel as well as operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. In each sq. km the stove with the highest net-benefit is chosen.
