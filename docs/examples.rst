Examples
========
The following section of the manual includes different examples using the OnStove code base in order to show what the code can be used for.

Jupyter example
***************
On the official repository of OnStove there is an example run of OnStove using Jupyter notebook. The notebook downloads the necessary datasets from a Mendeley database and runs an instace of the OnStove. The example goes through the entire workflow from start to finish. This includes GIS-processing, calibration of the baseline, calculating the net-benefits, visualizing and saving the results. The different steps are described more in depth in the notebook. The notebook can be found `here <https://github.com/Open-Source-Spatial-Clean-Cooking-Tool/OnStove/tree/main/example>`_
