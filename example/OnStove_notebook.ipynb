    "This is the OnStove notebook. The purpose of the notebook is to give users the ability to run through the analysis with example data and it can therefore act as a complement to the publication and read the docs documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is divded into 4 major parts: \n",
    "* **Data processing** - In this part of the analysis different geospatial datasets are read and processed to be used in the analysis. The datasets from this step are saved on the users computer. For future runs on the same area of interest this step can consquently be skipped unless datasets are switched. \n",
    "* **Calibration** - In this part the area of interest is calibrated. Raster cells are classified as either urban or rural, the electrification rate in different cells are determined and the rates of differet cooking fuels across settlements are calibrated. The calibrated data is saved in .pkl-file   \n",
    "* **Model run** - The net-benefit for different stoves are determined in different parts of the study area. Summaries of the results documenting the benefits and costs of each stove type across the entire study area are produced. The results are saved as .pkl-file.  \n",
    "* **Visualization** - Visulizing and saving different maps related to the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each part of the notebook is divided into several different cells and each cell is described more in depth."
